# Privacy-aware-system-for-outdoor-people-detection-and-tracking
This project aims to develop a sophisticated yet privacy-conscious system for outdoor people detection and tracking. Leveraging cutting-edge mmWave technology in conjunction with a thermal array sensor, our system ensures robust detection and tracking capabilities while prioritizing user privacy.

## Key Features:
**mmWave Technology:** Utilizing mmWave technology for precise detection and tracking of individuals in outdoor environments, enabling accurate positioning even in adverse weather conditions.

**Thermal Array Sensor:** Integration of a thermal array sensor to complement mmWave technology, providing additional data points for enhanced detection accuracy, particularly in low-light or challenging visual conditions.
